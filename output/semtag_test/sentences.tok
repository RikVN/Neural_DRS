So , what cards is Old Ma left with to play ?
Military purchase - fetus died in the womb ; .
Economic development - eclipsed by the prosperity of mainland China ; .
Culture - fully integrated with mainland China as well ; .
As for military affairs - Taiwanese soldiers , whether ex-service or in service , are all under the control of mainland China 's military departments .
As for the key Taiwanese figures who hold military power , mainland China has long ago convinced them with reasons .
Fellow countrymen should not slaughter one another , and brothers should not turn against one another - this makes the Taiwanese military less hostile towards mainland China .
As for the withdrawal of missiles proposed by Ma Ying-jeou , it is also no longer an issue now .
So what is Ma Ying-jeou still waiting for ? For a major change to take place in Taiwan ?
To mainland China , Ma Ying-jeou is no longer mainland China 's only choice .
Mainland China is actively seeking all forces in Taiwan that can be sought . Even the DPP is starting to change its course .
However , Ma Ying-jeou , who is holding on and keeping his mouth tight , has no other choices except mainland China , in other words , mainland China is Ma Ying-jeou 's only choice .
Basically , all the big bosses of the Kuomintang have visited mainland China and even received VIP treatment , getting all the respect they deserved .
So , is Ma Ying-jeou thinking about his future position or the great cause of the national unification ?
When Nixon visited China back then , he turned the Sino-American relationship around . So , does n't Ma Ying-jeou want his name to go down in history ?
Could it be that being the bill of a chicken is really better than being the anus of an ox ?
Hence , Ma Ying-jeou should understand that he is only one of the choices of mainland China . It is up to him whether he wants to achieve success and acquire fame .
Watch out for Ma Ying-jeou 's Continued Military Resistance against Unification by the Lease-to-own method .
Though the United States has recently increased its military presence in the Asia Pacific region , it is showing a rare undecided stand on the Taiwan issue .
The United States is no longer able to tell where Taiwan is heading , because all Taiwanese senior politicians are talking about unification and there is less and less talk about secession .
Furthermore , a certain tacit agreement between mainland China and Taiwan regarding the Diaoyu Islands has made the United States feel somewhat unable to do what it wants to do .
However , some people from the United States and Taiwan are still somewhat intelligent .
They no longer talk about military purchase but started proposing a lease-to-own method for Taiwan to get weapons .
The weapons Taiwan has now are old .
If it continues to take its old path of resisting unification through military forces , then it will meet a very tragic ending !
Diaoyu Islands Will be a Touchstone - Taiwan Can No Longer Turn Back .
Of course , there are still many opportunities for mainland China and Taiwan . For example , the Diaoyu Islands is the first touchstone of cooperation between mainland China and Taiwan .
When it comes to the Diaoyu Islands , mainland China and Taiwan can jointly deploy naval vessels , jointly defend the Diaoyu Islands , and join hands in fighting Japan .
Recently , within Taiwan , active actions have been taken concerning the ownership of Taiwan as well .
It is these changes that made the entire Taiwan , from top to bottom , reach a consensus that it can survive by staying close to mainland China .
Facing mainland China 's offensive efforts towards unification , Taiwan can no longer turn back .
Taiwan will become another traitor if it goes into Japan 's embrace . Only by going into mainland China 's embrace will Taiwan have a bright future !
In short , James Soong is merely someone through whom mainland China 's stance ranging from active cooperation to slight warning is demonstrated .
If Ma Ying-jeou does not want to oversleep after going back to bed in the morning , he must truly face what the people of both sides of the Strait have been hoping for for a century !
It is up to him whether he wants to be a sinner of the nation or a meritorious contributor to the nation !
When that time comes , the people of mainland China will respond enthusiastically to Ma Ying-jeou !
What 's going on !
Damn , these people who do n't learn to be good should rot at home . Why are they coming out ?
Endangering the society !
Really , one should not be a Samaritan .
If you help the other person get up but she does not appreciate it and even pushes you , then you should not help her anymore .
Yet you help her again .
Do n't tell jokes at the seaside . It will trigger tsunami .
It is really too tragic .
Meeting violence with violence does not benefit anyone .
Woes of the society .
Those who make trouble after getting drunk should be punished without leniency . Detestable .
The following is a quote from Qiuyeyuanmaoerkong from the second posting .
The perpetrators are not going to be held responsible just because they said they are poor !? Who dares to be a Samaritan in future !? .
It is really tough being a good person .
The old man was looking for trouble .
Nowadays , there are many scumbags around ~ .
The following is a quote from * Miyamiya * from the seventh posting .
Nowadays , one should not do evil , but one should not do good , either .
Damn , nowadays one should not be a good person .
`` The society always makes you feel painfully scared . Every day , there always seem to be countless reasons that make people curse ! '' .
This is well said .
This is what you call unforeseen misfortune .
People say , do not do good things . He did n't listen . sigh , .
Scary .
The following is a quote from Ninth Inspiration from the tenth posting .
What 's going on ! Damn , these people who do n't learn to be good should rot at home . Why are they coming out ? Endangering the society ! .
Why did n't they get knocked down by a car and die after getting drunk ? Scumbags !
The following is a quote from zhukong81 from the 16th posting .
Woes of the society .
Good people are beaten into extinction just like this , they 're all done for .
Right , you 're so old , why did you go and help a young man up . It 's tough to be a good person .
It 's tough to be a good person .
Never be a good person . Always remember .
If severe punishment is not given , in future everyone will pretend to be drunk and make trouble .

A Letter from the Victim 's Family .
It has been six days since the incident . As victims , we have the rights of a citizen to know some things .
1 . Where are the perpetrators from ? How are their family and financial conditions ?
2 . When can the case be submitted to the procuratorate ? When can public prosecution be initiated ?
3 . We hope the perpetrators can cooperate actively and take practical actions to work together to first save my father 's life .
4 . We request to meet the parents of the perpetrators .
We hope the news media can help us to jointly save the life of my kind-hearted father .
We also ask the government departments to coordinate with one another and be flexible to activate my father 's medical insurance card and save his life .
After the court verdict is out , all medical costs will be paid back to the medical insurance bureau .
A million thanks to the city residents and media for the concern they have shown us in this incident . May all you kind-hearted people have a life of peace !
Victim 's son .
Why helped him up when he was sleeping happily ?
Faint . The social morality system is about to collapse . Everything must be torn down and start all over again . Sigh .
Manhunt . Post the pictures of that bunch of perpetrators !
Tragedy .
What a turbulent society .
Nowadays , to be a good person is really not something you can do casually .
Hope the perpetrators can assume the responsibilities .
Nowadays , to be a good person is really not something you can do casually . Hope the perpetrators can assume the responsibilities .
Sentence all of them to life imprisonment and let 's see if they are going to pay .
Poor old man . He 's still stuck in the era of learning from Lei Feng . The society today is a mess .
It 's tough to be a good person !
It 's tough to be a good person !
Punish severely ! It looks like we have to mind our own business !
It is legal as long as three hours of sunshine can be achieved .
Most high-rise buildings with a spacing of 100 meters can certainly achieve that .
Three hours of sunshine , from morning till night , can certainly be achieved .
Even if there is a court judgment confirming that the developer is not against the law , they will still persist with their unreasonable demands .
